Smuploader (modified)
===========

Some modifications by tortue-b to handle Python 3 and Python virtual environment

This script is for uploading / downloading images from smugmug.com, using your command line. It uses OAuth for authentication.


Requirements
------------

You can install Smuploader:

  git clone https://github.com/tortue-B/smuploader.git  
	cd smuploader  
	python3 -m venv env  
	source env/bin/activate  
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

You may need to patch rauth due to a Type issue:

  patch -p0 -i rauth.patch


Files
-----

* smugmug.py - The core library for communicating with SmugMug
* smregister - Tool for registering your credentials with SmugMug
* smuploader - Tool for uploading images to your account
* smdownloader - Tool for dowloading images from your account
* smregtest - Test the library

Usage
-----

You first need to configure the script, by running the following command and following instructions. It will instruct you to generate a personal API access key.

	smregister

After setup, you can run the following command to check if everything is working. It creates a new album into your smugmug account, uploads a sample image, and downloads it back again. The script will show a lot of verbose output, and should conclude with OK or FAILED.

	smregtest

Now you can start uploading. As input, you can give either images or directories. For example, upload a single image to a new album:

	smuploader -a AlbumName path/to/image.jpg

Upload a whole directory as an album:

	smuploader path/to/album/

Upload a whole directory, and manually set a new album name:

	smuploader -a AlbumName path/to/album/*

Upload a directory, set password to "pass" and category to "Photos":

	smuploader -p pass -c Photos path/to/album/

Upload multiple directories, and set album names for directory names:

	smuploader path/to/multiple/albums/*

Use the --help argument to get the list of all options, such as setting the password, template and category:

	smuploader --help

You can also download an album from smugmug to your local machine:

	smdownloader -a AlbumName path/to/destination/

Use quotes if the album name contains spaces:

	smdownloader -a 'My Long Album Name' path/to/destination/

Finally, you can also download all the albums in your account:

	smdownloader --getall path/to/destination/

PyPi Details
------------
Packaging and uploading:

Use twine (not python setup.py):

	pip install twine

	python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

	twine upload dist/* --skip-existing

Don't forget to inc the version in setup.py!
